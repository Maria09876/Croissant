            A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired
            by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
            yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
            historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled
            and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
            sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
            layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

            The origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the 13th
            century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The kipferl can be
            made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the
            rugelach a form of kipferl). The birth of the croissant itself—that
            is, its adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl, before the
            invention of viennoiseries—can be dated to at least 1839 (some say
            1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a
            Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in
            Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the
            kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired
            French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie,
            a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The
            French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant)
            shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the
            world.

              According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in
              detail, a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at
              a time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686)
              was under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling
              sounds which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish
              attempt to invade the city by tunneling under the walls. The
              tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the
              exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the
              incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam. He was duly
              rewarded in this way, and the croissant was born. The story seems
              to owe its origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred
              Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant for the first edition
              [1938] of the Larousse Gastronomique and there gave the legend in
              the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686 version; but on the history
              of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683' version.</em
