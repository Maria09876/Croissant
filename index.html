    <h1>The story about Croissants</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry
        <b> inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl</b> but using the
        French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and
        folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
        technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture, similar to a puff pastry.

        , and came in various shapes. The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts
        or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of kipferl). The
        birth of the croissant itself—that is, its adaptation from the plainer
        form of kipferl, before the invention of viennoiseries—can be dated to
        at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August
        Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de
        Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialties
        including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and
        inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of
        viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries).
        The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant)
        shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.

        Stories of how the Kipferl — and so, ultimately, the croissant — was
        created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to
        the 19th century. However, there are no contemporary sources for any of
        these stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not
        mention the Kipferl in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods. The
        legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the
        defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in
        732, with the shape representing the Islamic crescent; that it was
        invented in Buda; or, according to other sources, in Vienna in 1683 to
        celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans by Christian forces in the siege of
        the city, as a reference to the crescents on the Ottoman flags, when
        bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the
        alarm.

        The above mentioned Alan Davidson proposed that the Islamic origin story
        originated with 20th-century writer Alfred Gottschalk, who gave two
        versions, one in the Larousse Gastronomique and the other in his History
        of Food and Gastronomy:
        <br />
        <em>
          According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in
          detail, a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a
          time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was
          under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds
          which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to
          invade the city by tunneling under the walls. The tunnel was blown up.
          The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake
          crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent
          being the symbol of Islam. He was duly rewarded in this way, and the
          croissant was born. The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its
          wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant
          for the first edition [1938] of the Larousse Gastronomique and there
          gave the legend in the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686 version; but
          on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683'
          version.</em
